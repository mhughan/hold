Being on hold is soul crushing. You can try to multitask, but the soft hum of the music or worse, promotional prose, reverberates through your soul. The anxiety of listening closely enough to not miss the agent joining prevents you from really focusing on anything else.

Some companies allow you to leave your number and they'll call you back. *But will they?* Will callers who stay on the line be prioritized above you? It's not transparent.

**Stay sane!** Stay on the line, but put your phone down. Listen to your own music. Blend a smoothie. Have a conversation. We'll text you when the agent is available and about to join your call.
